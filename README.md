# **ComfyEngine**  

Qt-based memory scanner / watchlist playground inspired by Cheat Engine but built natively for Linux and tuned for my workflow: clean docks, pointer graphs, fast patching, and zero fear of losing context when you bounce between scanner, scripts, and notes.

ComfyEngine gives you a clean, modern, Linux-first alternative to CE without the ceserver headache. All docks are movable, all colors follow your Qt theme, and all tools live in one workspace.

```

Executable lives at:

```
build/src/comfyengine
```

Helper tools (`test_watch`, `ce_watch`) live in the repo root.

## **Install (AUR)**

ComfyEngine has an official AUR package:

### **Git (development) version**

```bash
yay -S comfyengine-git
```

This builds the latest commit directly from GitHub.

### **Manual build**

If you want to build without AUR:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kashithecomfy/ComfyEngine
cd ComfyEngine
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

---

## **Usage**

1. Launch ComfyEngine
2. Click **Select Process…**, choose your target
3. Enter a value in **Memory Scan**
4. Hit **First Scan**, then **Next Scan**
5. Double-click results to send them to your watchlist
6. Right-click any address for patching, tracing, watching, etc.
7. Use toolbar for Auto Assembler, Memory Viewer, Pointer Scanner
8. Configure refresh cadence in **Settings**

ComfyEngine keeps your layout and preferences across sessions using QSettings.

---

## **Tests**

Run the full test suite:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Or run the internal test tool:

```bash
./build/test_watch
```

Register new suites via `add_test()` in the relevant CMakeLists.
